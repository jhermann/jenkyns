<h1>Jenkyns</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><code>jenkyns</code> (ˈdʒɛŋkaɪnz) is a command line tool that helps with the daily
management of your Jenkins jobs, implemented using Python and with a
focus on but not limited to Python projects. The main goal is to automate
configuration tasks and make new project setups simple and fast, and
systematic changes to a set of similar jobs easy.</p>

<p>Unlike <code>jenkins-cli.jar</code> which uses JNLP to communicate, <code>jenkyns</code> relies on
the REST API and thus imposes less preconditions (if Jenkins works in your
browser, so will the tool).</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The documentation for the current GitHub master source is located at
<a href="http://jhermann.github.io/jenkyns/">github.io</a>.
