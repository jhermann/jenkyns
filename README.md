## Overview
`jenkyns` (ˈdʒɛŋkaɪnz) is a command line tool that helps with the daily
management of your Jenkins jobs, implemented using Python and with a
focus on but not limited to Python projects. The main goal is to automate
configuration tasks and make new project setups simple and fast, and
systematic changes to a set of similar jobs easy.

Jenkyns can also be found on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jenkyns)
and [Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/p/jenkyns).
