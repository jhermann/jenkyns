# Jenkyns

## Overview
`jenkyns` (ˈdʒɛŋkaɪnz) is a command line tool that helps with the daily
management of your Jenkins jobs, implemented using Python and with a
focus on but not limited to Python projects. The main goal is to automate
configuration tasks and make new project setups simple and fast, and
systematic changes to a set of similar jobs easy.

Unlike `jenkins-cli.jar` which uses JNLP to communicate, `jenkyns` relies on
the REST API and thus imposes less preconditions (if Jenkins works in your
browser, so will the tool).

[autojenkins](https://github.com/txels/autojenkins) is a similar project.
