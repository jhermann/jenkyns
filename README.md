# Jenkyns

## Overview
`jenkyns` is a command line tool that helps with the daily management of your 
Jenkins jobs, implemented using Python and with a focus on but not limited to
Python projects. The main goal is to automate configuration tasks and make
new project setups simple and fast, and systematic changes to a set of similar
jobs easy.

Unlike `jenkins-cli.jar` which uses JNLP to communicate, `jenkyns` relies on
the REST API and thus imposes less preconditions (if Jenkins works in your
browser, so will the tool).


## Jenkyns Concepts

locations: \[»instance«:]»jobname«


## Installing jenkyns

To install Jenkyns from source, use these commands:

    # Make sure you have the "python-virtualenv" package installed on your machine
    mkdir -p ~/bin ~/.config/jenkyns
    virtualenv --no-site-packages ~/.config/jenkyns/venv
    ~/.config/jenkyns/venv/bin/pip install -e git+https://github.com/jhermann/jenkyns.git#egg=jenkyns
    ln -nfs ../.config/jenkyns/venv/bin/jenkyns ~/bin

Now try to call `jenkyns -h` which should print the command help. If the command is not found,
`~/bin` might not yet be in your path, enter `exec $SHELL -l` and try to call `jenkyns -h` again.
