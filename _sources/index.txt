Welcome to the jenkyns documentation!
=====================================

jenkyns (ˈdʒɛŋkaɪnz) is a command line tool that helps with the daily management of your Jenkins jobs, implemented using Python and with a focus on but not limited to Python projects. The main goal is to automate configuration tasks and make new project setups simple and fast, and systematic changes to a set of similar jobs easy.
